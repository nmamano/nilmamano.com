In this blog post, we will go over a correct implementation of timers in online turn-based games like chess.

After implementing timers for [wallwars.net](https://wallwars.net), I realized it is not trivial.
With my first (careless) implementation, there wasn't a clear source of truth for the timers, so if a player moved right before their timer run out, they could think the game kept going while the opponent saw that they timed out.

## Flow diagram

## Lag compensation

## Optimistic client-side rendering
