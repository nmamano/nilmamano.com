## Context

See context in [robot_instructions.md](mdc:robot_instructions.md)

We are migrating a personal site from raw html/css.

- Suggest only one step at a time. Do not give multiple steps. Wait for one step to be completed and user to confirm that it is working before suggesting the next one.
- Provide any validations that can be done to ensure each step is working.
- If there are alternative ways of doing something, suggest the alternatives.
- keep configuration standard. if something is not standard, add comments explaining why it is necessary.

## Preferences

Preferences:
- typescript over javascript.
- bun over node.
- if i make a suggestion that you think is bad, say so, don't just go along.

## Migration info

We'll keep the structure and content the same but we'll redo the styling.
